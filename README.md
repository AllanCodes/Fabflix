# Fabflix

A searchable database of thousands of movies developed using Java servlets and JSP, data stored in mySQL, and website deployed on AWS and GCP.  A scaled down version was created for Android to incorporate search only.  There were 3 AWS instances, one for accessing the website via load balancers using Apache, and a Master and Slave instance.  The Google instance acted as yet another load balancer. Jmeter for load tests.
